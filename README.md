# TEMPORAL SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION OF ONLINE HOTEL REVIEWS IN KENYA
## Overview
Online reviews are increasingly becoming a reference for information for both potential customers
and travelers in Kenya and across the globe. This project aims to develop a temporal and aspect-based sentiment analysis
platform for hotel reviews using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), aspect mapping and Support
Vector Machines (SVM).
